This is my first program in javascript. I don't actually know any
javascript yet, and I already see a lot of bad style here which needs to
be fixed (I think I've defined everything as global variables?).
I just wanted to have a demo project to work on as I read through
_Javascript: The Good Parts_. So, hopefully, this will improve with time.

That said, this first commited version DOES produce the correct output.
(At least for rotors I,II,III and reflector B.) At the time of this
writing, it's been about 5 minutes since I got my output to match that of a
couple of other simulators found online, so I haven't tested other rotor
configurations yet. That'll come later, along with a user interface.
